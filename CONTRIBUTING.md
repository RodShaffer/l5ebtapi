# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/rodshaffer/l5ebtapi).

I am looking for contributors to the project as I am doing everything right now. Anyone interested in contributing may
contact me directly. Rod Shaffer htmlplus43@yahoo.com

I am also aware that their is already a PHP package developed but I wanted to develop my own and I only use the Trading
API so that is why the package will only support the Trading API.

The package is being developed using Laravel 5.2 and PhpStorm. So far I have been able to accomplish everything simply
using SimpleXML, DOMDocument, GuzzleHttp. Other then the four API methods I currently have written this is pretty much
a skeleton project. Everything in place and working for the package without too many dependencies.

I need contributors with all kinds of experience. I'm not only looking for programmers but also anyone that would be
interested in writing documentation. However I am sure their are also other ways I have missed how someone could
contribute. This is my first project ever so it's also a learning process.


## Pull Requests

- **[PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)** - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP Code Sniffer](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer).

- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.
